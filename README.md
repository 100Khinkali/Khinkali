Hello world

    My name is Omar Lomsadze, from Georgia and this is my final project for the cs50 program

    I got the project Idea from my grandmother. its essentially a journal for people who needs to keep track of their medicine intake and blood pressure.
In form of a table people can write when they took blood pressure and sugar tests(which my grandmother does in every 3 hours)and their results and in form of a simple check mark
and see if on that particular time they took the medicine. the name of the medicine can be added and deleted as one may think appropriate.
